# polkadot-packages-jest-typescript-setup

Currently this setup works for the:

- Polkadot api `4.10.1`
- jest `27.0.0-next.9`
- ts-jest `27.0.0-next.12`
- pnpm

This intentionally uses pnpm because i use it in the other project and need a place to test. So All PRs suggestions and improvements are welcome.

I hope this repo becomes good place for the ref on how to setup polkadot api and utils after they decide to change stuff again. ðŸ™‚
